Whenever a component is created should be declared inside the angular.module.ts
in the NgModule we have declarations , imports, providers, bootstrap, 
The newly created modules should be defined inside the declarations and in the import we should only give component but not component.js
Example 
when you create a component we have .ts, .html, .css file
after it is added in the ngmodules of app.module.ts we need to import it
consider we have warning component we write import as 
import {WarningComponent} from {./warning/warning.component}
